# Ivan's sidebar.py script creates doc_sidebar.yml from this simplified tree structure.
# Text here becomes text in the sidebar at the corresponding tree (DOCS-indentation) level.
# Numbers here are file link IDs that correspond to sidebar_link: entries found in the .md file headers. 
# File link IDs are only allowed on tree level 3 and, when level 3 is just a heading, level 4.
# Also, due to the way Jekyll parses the tree, each level 3 immediately below a level 2 MUST have a link.
