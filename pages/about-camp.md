<span style="color:red">***A big thank you to Sky for capturing the essence of camp on this page! :-) Anyone else have suggestions for improvement?***</span>

Unlike the typical DUP/Sufi camps that happen at a contained retreat venue with on-site lodging and meals, the Puerto Morelos camp is integrated into the town with:

* Most meals taking place in small groups in restaurants
* Lodging spread out in various places (hotels, vacation rentals, airbnbs. etc...)

Typically, around 70 dancers participate each year, from seasoned veterans to first-time dancers. If you've been to any of Bernie or Sky's other camps, you'll undoubtedly be among old friends.

Because camp is an open container, rather than a closed one, it embraces a number of non-dance activities that enhance people’s experience such as:

* Snorkeling
* Cenote trips
* Mayan ruin trips
* Hanging out at the beach palapa
* Walks on the beach
* Exploring restaurants and cuisines
* Spending time one-on-one or in small groups with other attendees
* Music jams
* And for those who desire to attend, even a Super Bowl party in years when the game happens during camp.

All of these experiences allow for a spaciousness that most camps don’t have. 

We also believe the community creates the experience. Rather than having a focus on specific teachers, our core values are connection and Presence, both within and outside the Dance sessions.

This vision was set into place by Bernie, later joined by Sky, and you can see more about how we work at [https://skyness.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Bernie-and-Sky-Why-come.pdf](https://skyness.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Bernie-and-Sky-Why-come.pdf){:target="_blank"}.
