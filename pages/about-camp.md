Unlike the typical DUP/Sufi camps that happen at a contained retreat venue with on-site lodging and meals, the Puerto Morelos camp is integrated into the town with:

* Most meals taking place in small groups in restaurants
* Lodging spread out in various places (hotels, vacation rentals, airbnbs. etc...)

Typically, around 70 dancers participate each year, from seasoned veterans to first-time dancers. If you’ve attended any of the Western Slope Dance Camp events with Bernie, Sky, and Jen (Canyonlands, Paonia, Mancos, Joyful Journey, etc...) or this camp for that matter, you’ll undoubtedly be among old friends. The group’s ethos is one of warm and welcome regardless of familiarity, so please join us!

Because camp is an open container, rather than a closed one, it embraces a number of non-dance activities that enhance people’s experience such as:

* Snorkeling
* Cenote trips
* Mayan ruin trips
* Hanging out at the beach palapa
* Walks on the beach
* Exploring restaurants and cuisines
* Community offerings led by camp participants, like afternoon watercolor painting, playback theatre, universal worship service, and sessions on a variety of topics depending on the gifts, skills, and wisdom present amongst us!
* Spending time one-on-one or in small groups with other attendees
* Music jams
* And for those who desire to attend, even a Super Bowl party in years when the game happens during camp.

All of these experiences allow for a unique feeling of spaciousness and a collaborative, co-creative spirit unique to our community.

We believe that the community creates the experience rather than having a focus on a specific teacher. Our core values are connection, open-heartedness, and Presence, both within and outside the Dance sessions.

This vision was set into place over 20 years ago by Bernie and Adrianna Heideman, later joined by Sky Roshay, and then Jen Friedman.

This year, we hope to carry forward the legacy of joy and love which has always made the Puerto Morelos Dance Camp such a special experience.
