Once we get to Puerto Morelos, these setup items need doing prior to camp. Come join in the fun starting on Wednesday Feb 11 and (hopefully) finishing on Thursday Feb 12. 

- Help pull weeds, pick stones, and groom the sand to create a beautiful place to dance.
- Help assemble the retractable shade sail, which allows us to dance in the shade in the daytime and under the stars at night. 
- Help set up the community kitchen (Las Arenas room 102).
- Other errands and tasks as needed in the moment.

> If we are far enough along by Thursday evening, we will christen the space with a pre-camp dance session.
