----- From form ---

We have booked the entire Hotel Las Arenas Puerto Morelos for 10 nights (Feb 11 check in to Feb 21 check out) and several rooms for a few additional nights before and after.

As we learned during camp last year, retail prices for the rooms have risen (to as much as 1800 pesos/night) with beachside rooms now costing more than poolside rooms. But miraculously, the total hotel group rate we negotiated amazingly allows us to charge the same 1200 pesos per night as last year ($70usd @ 17.14 pesos/dollar) for ***10-night-stay\*** beachside rooms and even less for poolside rooms!

***All prices below are in Mexican pesos. The actual dollar (USD or CDN) price you pay gets determined using the exchange rate at the time you pay.\*** ***All dollars collected will be converted to pesos at the time collected.\***

No one knows what the impact of the US presidential election will have on the money markets, so we are giving you the ability to decide when your dollars get converted to pesos. You can either:

- Pay sooner to avoid unknown future exchange rate fluctuations.
- Pay later to hang on to your money until you feel the time is right for you.

Complete and submit this form to request lodging at Hotel Las Arenas.

Please give your best guess for your dates below. Camp will most likely unoffically start Wed, Feb 12 with dance-space prep and a dance that evening, just like last year. If, when you book plane tickets, your dates need to change slightly, please contact us immediately and we'll do what we can to accomodate you.

We have booked the entire 30-room Hotel Las Arenas Puerto Morelos for 10 nights (Feb 11 check in to Feb 21 check out) and several of the rooms for a few additional nights before and after. On December 1, we will need to release the unbooked additional rooms back to the hotel, so the sooner you book, the better chance a room will be available for your dates.

As we learned during camp last year, retail prices for the rooms have risen (to as much as 1800 pesos/night) with beachside rooms now costing more than poolside rooms. ***But miraculously***, the total hotel group rate we negotiated amazingly allows us to charge the same peso amount per night as last year (~$70usd @ 17 pesos/dollar) for 10-night-stay beachside rooms and ***even less*** for poolside rooms!

**Total prices listed here are in Mexican pesos.** <span style="color:red">*The actual dollar (USD or CDN) price you pay gets determined using the exchange rate at the time you pay.*</span> This approach:

*  Allows us to offer you the same peso price as last year.

* Gives you the flexibility to pay when you feel most comfortable doing so. No one knows what the impact of the US presidential election will have on the money markets, so this approach gives you options. You can either:

  * Pay sooner to avoid unknown future exchange rate fluctuations.

  * Pay later to hang on to your money until you feel the time is right for you.
