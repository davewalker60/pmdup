We have booked the entire Hotel Las Arenas Puerto Morelos for 10 nights (Feb 11 check in to Feb 21 check out) and several of the rooms for a few additional nights before and after. On December 1, we will need to release the unbooked additional rooms back to the hotel, so the sooner you book, the better chance a room will be available for your dates.

As expected, prices for the rooms have risen from last year and beachside rooms now cost more than poolside rooms. ***But miraculously***, the 10-night total hotel group rate we negotiated amazingly allows us to charge you the same amount as dancers paid for rooms last year (~$70usd @ 17 pesos/dollar) for beachside rooms and ***even less*** for poolside rooms!

**All prices listed here are in Mexican pesos.** <span style="color:red">*The actual dollar (CDN or USD) price you pay gets determined using the exchange rate at the time you pay.*</span> This approach:

*  Allows us to offer you the same peso price as last year.

* Gives you the flexibility to pay when you feel most comfortable doing so. Either:

  * Pay sooner to avoid future exchange rate fluctuations.

  * Pay later to hang on to your money longer.
