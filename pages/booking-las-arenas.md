We have booked the entire 30-room Hotel Las Arenas Puerto Morelos for 10 nights (Feb 11 check in to Feb 21 check out) and several of the rooms for a few additional nights before and after. On December 10, we must release the unbooked additional rooms back to the hotel, so the sooner you book, the better chance a room will be available for your dates.

As we learned during camp last year, prices for the rooms have risen (to as much as 1800 pesos/night) with beachside rooms now costing more than poolside rooms. ***But miraculously***, the total hotel group rate we negotiated amazingly allows us to charge the same $70 per night as last year (assuming the exchange rate remains above 17 pesos/dollar) for 10-night-stay beachside rooms and ***even less*** for poolside rooms!

# Payment

Pay through PayPal or Venmo, just like we did last year. If you can't do either, pay by check.

You can pay anytime in 2024, but note, if you wait and the exchange rate drops below 17 pesos/US dollar, we'll need to adjust your price in this way:
 
- The actual dollar (USD or CDN) price you pay would be determined using the exchange rate at the time you pay.
- Dollars collected would be converted to pesos at the time collected.

# Cancellation policy

Full refund with sufficiently-creative excuse, provided there are still people on the waitlist and your room gets filled. Cancellation close to retreat time may result in partial or no refund.
