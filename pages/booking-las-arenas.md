We have booked the entire 30-room Hotel Las Arenas Puerto Morelos for 10 nights (Feb 11 check in to Feb 21 check out) and several of the rooms for a few additional nights before and after. On December 10, we will need to release the unbooked additional rooms back to the hotel, so the sooner you book, the better chance a room will be available for your dates.

As we learned during camp last year, retail prices for the rooms have risen (to as much as 1800 pesos/night) with beachside rooms now costing more than poolside rooms. ***But miraculously***, the total hotel group rate we negotiated amazingly allows us to charge the same $70 per night as last year (assuming the exchange rate remains above 17 pesos/dollar) for 10-night-stay beachside rooms and ***even less*** for poolside rooms!

No one knows what the impact of the US presidential election will have on the money markets, <span style="color:red">If the exchange rate drops below 17 pesos/US dollar, we'll need to adjust the prices in this way:</span>

- The actual dollar (USD or CDN) price you pay would be determined using the exchange rate at the time you pay.
- Dollars collected would be converted to pesos at the time collected.

<span style="color:red">So, we are giving you the ability to decide when your dollars get converted to pesos.</span> You can either:

- Pay sooner to avoid the generally-forecasted predicted drop in the exchange rate.
- Pay later to hang on to your money until you feel the time is right for you.
