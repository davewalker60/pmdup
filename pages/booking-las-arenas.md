We have booked the entire 30-room Hotel Las Arenas Puerto Morelos for 10 nights (Feb 11 check in to Feb 21 check out) and several of the rooms for a few additional nights before and after. On December 1, we will need to release the unbooked additional rooms back to the hotel, so the sooner you book, the better chance a room will be available for your dates.

As we learned during camp last year, retail prices for the rooms have risen (to as much as 1800 pesos/night) with beachside rooms now costing more than poolside rooms. ***But miraculously***, the total hotel group rate we negotiated amazingly allows us to charge the same amount as last year (~$70usd @ 17 pesos/dollar) for 10-night-stay beachside rooms and ***even less*** for poolside rooms!

**Total prices listed here are in Mexican pesos.** <span style="color:red">*The actual dollar (CDN or USD) price you pay gets determined using the exchange rate at the time you pay.*</span> This approach:

*  Allows us to offer you the same peso price as last year.

* Gives you the flexibility to pay when you feel most comfortable doing so. Either:

  * Pay sooner to avoid future exchange rate fluctuations.

  * Pay later to hang on to your money longer.
