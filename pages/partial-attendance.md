### Partial attendance

- People not attending the full camp may attend individual morning or evening sessions for $25/session (425 pesos), provided they follow the [health care guidelines](health-care-guidelines.md).
- For the classes/offerings happening in the afternoons, simply make a donation to the person leading the offerings you attend.
- To foster outreach and share the joy of the Dances of Universal Peace, we are again welcoming locals to join us on a donation or completely-comped basis, as they can afford.
