### <span style="color:red">***&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2026 Hotel Las Arenas lodging registration is open. See below.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Camp registration will open in the fall. [Learn more here.](register.md))***</span>

<br>For 2026, the official camp will be held Fri Feb 13 to Thu Feb 19. Start and end times on those days, as well as likely pre- and post-camp dancing the days before and after, are all TBD at this time. Stay tuned...

We currently have 28 rooms reserved (and are hoping to again book the entire 30-room Hotel Las Arenas Puerto Morelos) for 10 nights (Wed Feb 11 check in to Sat Feb 21 check out). We will also do our best to reserve rooms for additional nights before and after, based on the best guess dates you supply in the lodging form.

<span style="color:red">**PLEASE READ CAREFULLY:**</span><br>
**To be part of the initial room selection process, each camp participant please complete and submit the [Hotel Las Arenas Lodging](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSct3SrTHl76pMYcZ5z9-eWdLCjCXzf4igqfVk689qA42YuyWA/viewform){:target="_blank"} form and send a non-refundable $100 USD (or 2000 MXN) deposit by May 28, 2025. Your *per-person* deposit is non-refundable whether you cancel of your own accord or in the unlikely event of us losing the nearly $4000 hotel deposit due to circumstances beyond our control (eg, hurricane, change of hotel ownership, etc).**

If you don't want to send the deposit now or you can only attend camp for part of the time, select the appropriate waitlist options on the form to be in the running for rooms still available closer to camp time. (We also highly recommend booking a cancellable reservation elsewhere -- so you can cancel if something opens up at the hotel last minute -- and do so soon, as prices tend to skyrocket close to retreat time. Check out our [Lodging Options](lodging-options.md) web page for many other places we know of to stay in Puerto Morelos.)

# Payment

Use Wise, Venmo, or PayPal (just like we did last year). If you don't do electronic payments, you can mail a US check.

<span style="color:red">*Your stay is not reserved and your room preference is not prioritized until your $100 USD non-refundable deposit is received. **Deposits are per person (not per room).***</span>

You can pay the balance anytime before Jan 15, 2026, but note, if the exchange rate drops below 18 pesos/usd before you send the balance, your price will be higher:
* The actual dollar (USD or CDN) price you pay would be determined using the exchange rate at the time you pay.
* Dollars collected would be converted to pesos at the time collected.

# Cancellation policy

Full refund (less $100 USD non-refundable deposit) with sufficiently-creative excuse, provided there are still people on the waitlist and your room gets filled. Cancellation close to retreat time may result in partial or no refund.

# What to expect at our favorite 2-star hotel

We set up a simple community kitchen in room 102. It has:

* Microwave
* Two-burner hot plate
* Larger mini fridge
* Sink
* Dish rack
* Coffee maker
* Water kettle
* Small selection of pots, pans, dishes, silverware, and cooking utensils.
* 20L drinking water dispensers (provided both here and at the dance circle during dance sessions, but not in individual rooms during the retreat days)
* Safe (for people without one in their room)

> Please clean your cooking dishes **before** eating, so others can use them. And please thoroughly clean up after yourself! Your mother doesn't live here... (...unless you're name is Amber! :-) )

While it's "the finest 2-star Mexican hotel on the beach you'll ever meet", staying does have its drawbacks. But hey, it's Mexico!

* Hot water might not be available at all times.
* Most rooms have torn or missing screens. Each year they do their best to fix them for us.
* Not all rooms have fridges, safes, microwaves. Use the ones in the community kitchen (room 102) if you don't have them in your room.
* Not all rooms have TVs and there is no cable (just WiFi for your NetFlix, etc). 
* Not all rooms have working fans and air conditioners, though they tend to get them fixed quickly.
* It might take a couple of days to get two room keys, batteries replaced in the safe, etc.
* The toilet seat hinges tend to break easily.
* Shampoo yes, but no conditioner, body gel, or body lotion is provided.
* Some refrigerators have broken or missing shelves. Tape can be a partial remedy.
* Freezers drip water into the refrigerators.
* Hot water handles in the king room showers get scalding hot and can burn.
* Gaps in door and window frames allow sand and mosquitos.
* Any food you leave out will attract hundreds of ants.
* Some rooms have poor mattresses.
* Interesting smells occasionally rise from the shower drains, especially after a hard rain.
