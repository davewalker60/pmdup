<span style="color:red">Which is better, using this mini-TOC or putting each section on its own page?</span>

This page describes tourist attractions in and around Puerto Morelos that have been popular with our community. We highly recommend arriving a few days early and/or staying longer to take in all the Riviera Maya has to offer.

# Beaches

The main attraction of the Riviera Maya are the beaches. Our camp takes place immediately adjacent to Puerto Morelos' main beach with a very large swimming area, roped off to keep the boats out, and the world's second largest coral reef in the distance.

The swimming area in February is usually slightly cooler than the consistent 81 degrees Fahrenheit gulf stream water temperature, depending on the weather. The current is consistent from north to south inside the reef, while [the wind](#la-brisa-caribe) primarily comes out of the southeast.

## Beach palapa

Dancers staying in Puerto Morelos for as much as a month rent a palapa (thatched-roof umbrella and chairs) on the beach directly in front of Hotel Las Arenas. Camp covers the cost of the palapa during camp, making it available for all camp registrants during camp. And if you are staying beyond camp, you can continue to use is by contributing to the rent.

## Sargasso / Sargassum

Since 2011, sargasso/sargassum has been breaking off from the [Sargasso Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargasso_Sea){:target="_blank"} in alarming rates and coming on shore in Florida and the Caribbean. The "season" has typically been from April to September, but has started as early as February in a couple of recent years. Feb '24 was far better than Feb '22 & '23. Predictions for Feb '25 are not yet available.

## La brisa caribe

The breeze coming off the ocean has a different quality that is so distinct it has its own name, pronounced *la BREE suh*. It is frequently constant and often up to 15 MPH. So, no matter how hot it gets a block away in town, the heat is often not an issue at the beach, especially when hanging out under the palapa.

# Snorkeling

The coral reef seen from shore is National Reef Park of Puerto Morelos, a designated national park and part of the [Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerican_Barrier_Reef_System){:target="_blank"}. Waves constantly breaking over the reef add to the picturesque beauty of Puerto Morelos.

## Snorkeling at the reef

A definite highlight of any trip to Puerto Morelos is a snorkeling trip out to the reef. The reef is just 10 minutes by boat. There are many hawkers who will try to sell you basically the same snorkel trip. We've been working with the same people for years and definitely get the best price. We also monitor the wind to pick the best day(s) to go out. Check with Dave Nur al-Haqq or Peggy for the latest info.

## Snorkeling from shore

There are several nice coral heads within the swimming area. The color isn't as vibrant as at the reef (due to the churning sand), but we often see more schools of fish. Wearing fins, it's just a five-minute swim out, and if you start at the north end of the swimming area, you can basically float in the current over all the coral heads. There are plenty of us who will explain onsite and/or accompany you. Be sure to bring snorkel gear if you can. Alternatively, you can rent it onsite or often borrow it from someone in our group. 

 Ojo de Agua (eye of the water) is a cenote that surfaces on the ocean floor in less than 20 feet of water. The fresh water mixes with sea water creating an interesting "translucent cloudiness" and sometimes as many as 1000 fish congregate there to enjoy the brackish water. The flat buoy floating straight out from our beach palapa marks the location. You'll find the ojo 20 feet or so toward shore  and a bit to the right of the marker.

> Swimming from shore to the reef is illegal (to protect the reef as well as keep people from swimming through the boat lane).

# Cenotes
The massive underground waterway throughout the Yucatan provides hundreds of wonderful pools of fresh water to swim in, called [*cenotes*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cenote){:target="_blank"} (pronounced *see NO tays*), with some above ground and others totally underground. Though quite rustic, cenote operators offer varying amenities such as tables, lounge chairs, palapas, food, drink, and of course access to the water.

We typically pack a lunch and spend an entire afternoon there. The water temperature is a consistent 25C (77F), so it's best to wear a swim top or t-shirt in the water. And be sure to bring a mask and snorkel (if you have them) to explore the stalactites and vegetation. Fins are not needed.

The cenote road, just south of Puerto Morelos, leads to at least a dozen different places. Some of our favorites are:
* Siete Bocas
* Verde Lucero
* Boca del Puma
* Kin Ha
* La Noria

# Mayan ruins
The [Mayan civilization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_civilization){:target="_blank"} lived in all of southeast Mexico (including the Yucatan Penninsula) and left behind many ruins, which archeologists have excavated and restored. The most popular amongst our dancers are:
* Tulum (right on the ocean shore)
* Chichen Itza
* Ek Balam
* Coba

# Mayan market
One block south of the town square on Javier Rojo Gomez, the Mayan market is a series of small shops run by people of Mayan heritgae. Many of the goods sold are created by local, and also there are plenty of typical (and not so typical) manufactured tourist souvenirs.

# Farmer’s market
Each Wednesday morning, the local farmer's market happens on the side street just off the SW corner of the town square.

# Artist's market
On Friday and Saturday evenings, the town square is host to many local artists selling there creations. 

# Botanical gardens
El Jardín Botánico Dr. Alfredo Barrera Marin](https://www.facebook.com/JBPuertoMorelos){:target="_blank"} is a hidden treasure just off the highway on the south edge of Puerto Morelos. Founded in 1982 to protect the region's flora, this 65-hectare jungle area is the largest botanical garden in Mexico. Plants are divided by type: cacti, ornamentals, palms, medicinal, and more.

It has been running on little funding for years, so it could use a little love, but is still well worth exploring. It also includes a [chiclero camp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicle){:target="_blank"}, a reading cabin, an archaeological zone with semi-excavated small ruins, a natural park, hanging bridges, and a climbing tower that overlooks the mangrove swamp.

# Interactive animal sanctuary
The [Croco Cun Zoo](https://www.crococunzoo.com/){:target="_blank"}, located just off the highway on the north edge of Puerto Morelos, gives guided "touch, hold, and feed" tours of its jungle creatures. Originally a rescues and rehabs sanctuary, it has become a very unique (their word is *peculiar*) place with crocodiles, snakes, wild monkeys, and more.

# Nightlife
While there is tourism pressure to become like Cancun, preservationist locals work hard to not have the quaint seaside village become an all-night party destination. There are a few places that have music until midnight, but most shops and restaurants roll up the sidewalks by 8:00. That said, a sampling of our favorite nightlife includes:
* Karaoke on Thursdays 8-10 at Layla Guesthouse
* Live bands (with varying musical genres depending on the night of the week) on the La Sirena rooftop
* Live (mostly rock) bands across the street from Las Arenas at Louro's (nicknamed *Loudo's* because it's so loud it's better enjoyed by listening from across the street.)
* More chill afternoon music with live duos Saturdays and Sundays 4:30 to 6:00 up the beach at Unico Beach Club

# Post-camp community
Many people stay for a week or even up to a month after camp, so consider joining in the fun! Over the years, "the longtimers" have built a unique sense of community. We:
* Sightsee all the above attractions together
* Extend camp with post-camp dances, music jams, qigong, art/drawing sessions, etc...
* Hang out at the beach palapa and snorkel together
* Go to lunches and dinners together
* Have potlucks
* Enjoy live music, karaoke, and movies together
