This page describes tourist attractions in and around Puerto Morelos that have been popular with our community. We highly recommend arriving a fe days early and/or staying longer to take in all the Riviera Maya has to offer.

# Beaches

The main attraction of the Riviera Maya are the beaches. Our camp takes place immediately adjacent to Puerto Morelos' main beach with a very large swimming area, roped off to keep the boats out, and the world's second largest coral reef in the distance.

The swimming area in February is usually slightly cooler than the consistent 81 degrees Fahrenheit gulf stream water temperature, depending on the weather. The current is consistent from north to south inside the reef, while [the wind](#la-brisa-caribe) primarily comes out of the southeast.

## Beach palapa

Dancers staying in Puerto Morelos for as much as a month rent a palapa (thatched-roof umbrella and chairs) on the beach directly in front of Hotel Las Arenas. Camp covers the cost of the palapa during camp, making it available for all camp registrants during camp. And if you are staying beyond camp, you can continue to use is by contributing to the rent.

## Sargasso / Sargassum

Since 2011, sargasso/sargassum has been breaking off from the [Sargasso Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargasso_Sea){:target="_blank"} in alarming rates and coming on shore in Florida and the Caribbean. The "season" has typically been from April to September, but has started as early as February in a couple of recent years. Feb '24 was far better than Feb '22 & '23. Predictions for Feb '25 are not yet available.

## La brisa caribe

The breeze coming off the ocean has a different quality that is so distinct it has its own name, pronounced *la BREE suh*. It is frequently constant and often up to 15 MPH. So, no matter how hot it gets a block away in town, the heat is often not an issue at the beach, especially when hanging out under the palapa.

# Snorkeling

The coral reef seen from shore is National Reef Park of Puerto Morelos, a designated national park and part of the [Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerican_Barrier_Reef_System){:target="_blank"}. Waves constantly breaking over the reef add to the picturesque beauty of Puerto Morelos.

## Snorkeling at the reef

A definite highlight of any trip to Puerto Morelos is a snorkeling trip out to the reef. The reef is just 10 minutes by boat. There are many hawkers who will try to sell you basically the same snorkel trip. We've been working with the same people for years and definitely get the best price. We also monitor the wind to pick the best day(s) to go out. Check with Dave Nur al-Haqq or Peggy for the latest info.

## Snorkeling from shore

There are several nice coral heads within the swimming area. The color isn't as vibrant as at the reef (due to the churning sand), but we often see more schools of fish. Wearing fins, it's just a five-minute swim out, and if you start at the north end of the swimming area, you can basically float in the current over all the coral heads. There are plenty of us who will explain onsite and/or accompany you. Be sure to bring snorkel gear if you can. Alternatively, you can rent it onsite or often borrow it from someone in our group. 

 Ojo de Agua (eye of the water) is a cenote that surfaces on the ocean floor in less than 20 feet of water. The fresh water mixes with sea water creating an interesting "translucent cloudiness" and sometimes as many as 1000 fish congregate there to enjoy the brackish water. The flat buoy floating straight out from our beach palapa marks the location. You'll find the ojo 20 feet or so toward shore  and a bit to the right of the marker.

> Swimming from shore to the reef is illegal (to protect the reef as well as keep people from swimming through the boat lane).
