Tihs page is an archive of all the red notes that were at the top of many pages during admin collaboration. 

# Homepage

<span style="color:red">Website creation in progress... As of April, most everything on this site still needs team collaboration (and accenting with photos that display well on a phone). Nothing, **including dates and prices**, is finalized yet...<br><br>As we discussed at our wrap up meeting in PM, the intention of the site is to replace last year's Google Doc with concise chunks of text, easily readable on a phone (as well as computer), that:<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Entice newcomers with info about DUP dancer life in Puerto Morelos before, during, and after the retreat time, including external activities available in QRoo.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Clearly explain to newcomers how this is a different kind of camp experience.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Provide all camp details so people can search for answers on their own.<br><br>I look forward to collaborating! To keep updating organized, use **Contact Us** at the top of any page at any time and capture your ideas for improving that page. Thanks!</span>

# About Camp

## Different Kind of Camp

<span style="color:red">***A big thank you to Sky for capturing the essence of camp on this page! :-) Anyone else have suggestions for improvement?***</span>

## Camp Schedule

<span style="color:red">***Placeholder/sample schedule (based on last year)***<br>Any descriptions to improve/add?</span>

## Staff

<span style="color:red">Needs updating once Jen decides who gets listed and how.<br>What would people like in your (about 120 words max) bios? If different photo, please make it 250x340.</span>

| <br><span style="font-size: 160%">**Bernie Heideman (hopefully)**</span><br>Bernie has been leading for over 30 years, was a founding leader at the original Canyonlands Camp, is on staff for Wilderness Camp, started the Puerto Morelos Winter Dance retreat, and has led at other events in the US, Europe and Russia. He is a master at explosive joy and wild energy, but underneath that apparent frivolity he is always guiding us into the presence of “Presence.”<br><br>He brings a lot of joy, laughter and music circles to his events and can hold a huge space for everyone to first expand into and then to sink into the depths of their own soul experience. | &nbsp; ![Bernie](../images/PM_Bernie.jpg)

## Camp History

<span style="color:red">This page could use some love. I've sent this to Bernie asking if he wants to contribute to it.</span>

# About OM & QRoo

## Attractions

<span style="color:red">Which is better, using this mini-TOC or putting each section on its own page?</span>

# Register & Book

## Register

<span style="color:red">Anything missing from included/not included lists?</span>

# Before Leaving Home

## WhatsApp

<span style="color:red"> We need to update this page when we decide what groups to have this year. We also need to decide whether to add names to the community ourselves (vs. rely on people to do it themselves). Now that WhatsApp has communities, it makes far more sense to add people as they reigster and let them then voluntarily join the groups that interest them.</span>

## Healthcare Guidelines


<span style="color:red">Everything below is last year's text just for reference. Does any of it need to be added above?</span>

## Covid Care Guidelines from 2024
Covid and other illnesses are on the rise again. To help keep everyone well, please:

- Be cautious in your interactions in crowded and indoor spaces for at least a week before traveling, 
- Consider increasing your supplement intake for that week (especially Vitamins C and D, and zinc) and gargling with Listerine after social engagements to help keep you healthy.
- Take a Covid test at home before traveling, 
- Wear a mask while traveling to camp and anytime you ride a collectivo before or during camp, 
- Take a Covid test the first afternoon right before we gather (and maybe bring some extras for others or in case you start feeling ill),
- Don’t come to sessions if you are feeling ill or have symptoms. 

Thank you for caring for all of us!

## All Topics

<span style="color:red">What do you think about the need for this page? Pages need to be short & easy to read on the phone, but that might frustrate people who want to scroll rather than tap repeatedly to navigate. This "all in one" page solves that issue but is way long. Alternatively, I can explore putting PREVIOUS | NEXT buttons at the bottom of all pages to advance through the topics sequentially.</span>

# Reference Info

## Links

<span style="color:red">If we don't set **Approve new members** on all groups, Irecommend against listing the WhatsApp link because it makes us susceptible to hackers and allows people to join without registering. On the other hand, iif we do require approval, we potentially could list all the groups here...</span>
