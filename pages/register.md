Registration is a multi-step process. Registering itself has three steps and there are additional steps for lodging and travel:
1. Check your passport now to verfiy that it will still be valid on the date you travel to Mexico.
2. Complete and submit [**the registration form**](snippets/coming-soon.md){:target="_blank"} (with your approximate travel dates) as soon as possible.
3. Send your registration payment as soon as is convenient (especially if you are including a scholarship donation) and **no later than December 15th**.
4. Determine how long you'd like to stay.
   * Some people arrive a few days early.
   * On the day before camp starts, we [prepare the dance space](preparing-dance-space.md) and, if we get done, have a pre-camp dance in the evening.
   * [Many people stay for a week or more after camp](attractions.md#post-camp-community), so consider extending your trip to join in the fun!
5. Once you've arranged your travel, complete [**the travel form**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSex7cyDs_Xf33rAxqU2S749xG_MB4lMQk3fPvF_p0JkkoKyTg/viewform){:target="_blank"}. Learn more about travel at:
