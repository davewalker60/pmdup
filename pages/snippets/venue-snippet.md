Camp takes place one block north of the beachside town square, immediately adjacent to the main Puerto Morelos beach, in two locations:

* Dance sessions take place on the ocean side of Hotel Las Arenas Puerto Morelos. We dance on the sandy ground under a retractable shade sail with a view of the ocean in the mornings and under the stars at night.
* Classes and late-night music jams take place across the side street next to the hotel at Alaska House, a private rental on the beach.
