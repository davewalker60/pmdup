# Portside / Beachside

Hotel Las Arenas Puerto Morelos is where we dance and where a good portion of us stay. We are working directly with the hotel (thanks Dave Nur al-Haqq!) and have a block of rooms (actually ¾ of the 30-room hotel at this point!) at a group rate that includes all taxes and avoids all online booking and cleaning fees. 

These are the hotels that we know of beachside. All are within a 15-minute walk of Hotel Las Arenas (where we dance), most are closer. Check Google Maps for distance to Hotel Las Arenas Puerto Morelos. 

- **Hotel Las Arenas** - The closest hotel to the beach and where we dance. We are working directly with the hotel (thanks Dave Nur al-Haqq!) and have booked the entire 30-room hotel at a 10-day group rate that includes all taxes and avoids all online booking & cleaning fees. <span style="color:red">***Hotel Las Arenas lodging registration is open!***</span> *[Learn more and book here](./booking-las-arenas.md).*
- **Amar Inn**
- **Cuca Macuca Hostel** - By far, the cheapest place to stay portside and right off the town square. Last we checked, a bed in a 6-bed dorm was $21/night on hostelworld.com (not sure if that includes taxes and online booking & cleaning fees).
- **Hacienda Morelos**
- **Hotel Caracol**
- **Hotel Ojo de Agua**
- **La Quinta Orquídea (Dr. Suess house)**
- **Layla Guest House**
- **Posada El Moro**
- **Villas Valentina**
- **We Hotel Puerto Morelos**
- **Casa Velero**
- **AirBnB-type places beachside** - AirBnB, Vrbo, etc don’t list exact addresses online, so if it says it’s more than a ½ mile from the city center, it’s probably out near the highway or across the highway in La Colonia. 

> Note: If you know of other places, please let us know and we'll update this page. Thanks!

# La Colonia

There are places across the highway in La Colonia too, often at better rates, but be aware that it's a 7-minute / 2-mile drive to the beach. Yes, there are taxis for 40 pesos ($2.35 US at 17 pesos/dollar) and "the collectivo" (10-peso public transportation), but past dancers rarely opt to do it a second time. 

While staying in La Colonia to immerse yourself in the local culture might sound intriguing, we do not recommend it merely due to the inconvenience. Most dancers who have stayed out there in the past say it’s not worth the financial savings because:

- All the added traveling back and forth
- The inconvenience of not having access to your lodging during the day without making a time-consuming trip
- Having to decide in the morning what to bring for the entire day and evening
- The extra cost of all those taxis
