Once we get to Puerto Morelos, these setup items need doing prior to camp. Come join in the fun starting (and hopefully finishing) on Tuesday Feb 11! 

- Help pull weeds, pick stones, and groom the sand to create a beautiful place to dance.
- Help assemble the retractable shade sail, which allows us to dance in the shade in the daytime and under the stars at night. 
- Help set up the community kitchen (Las Arenas room 102).
- Other errands and tasks as needed in the moment.
