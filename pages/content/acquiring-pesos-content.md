Consider acquiring pesos from your bank at home before traveling.

- If you are getting a ride through us, you don't have to have pesos with you upon arrival. You can pay our drivers in US dollars and the pre-determined price we set is at the current exchange rate.

- Anywhere else you use USD, expect to get a horrible exchange rate!

- Most people opt to get at least some pesos ahead of traveling. Most banks require that you have an account with them and it takes a couple of days to “order” them. Check the exchange rates and admin fees for the best rates. They can vary widely. Google _**USD to pesos**_ to see the current US Forbes rate. You'll never quite get this rate, but more and more these days you can get within a few cents.

- Exchange booths and ATMs at airports typically have bad rates, and Mexico is no exception.

- The exchange booths in PM give fairly decent rates. They are on the town square next to La Sirena and just past Chedraui on the ocean side.

- The ATMs in Mexico can be quirky and/or they regularly run out of pesos.

  > We **strongly** recommend using only ATMs that are physically connected to a bank and only when the bank is open. Much less scamming happens there and if the machine eats your card, the bank is there to help you recover it. The closest one to camp is at the entrance to the Chedraui in La Colonia just across the highway.

- Jan and Kevin created [this video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Sv9yaOiukrbtHwA6jmgeaU8XfWdDO2d3/view?usp=drive_link) explaining the importance of declining the ATM exchange rate at Mexican ATMs. It saved them about 7%!

- Be sure you are using a debit card in ATMs. Most banks treat ATM withdrawal using a credit card as a cash advance, which immediately starts accruing interest charges on your **entire** outstanding balance.

- Most basic credit cards charge a 3% foreign transaction fee. Check your cards. 

- Many restaurants accept USD, but typically for a horrible exchange rate. Watch closely.

> Pro tip: Remember to tell your bank(s) the dates you will be traveling in Mexico using your credit card and/or debit card to lower the chances of a fraud alert while you’re in PM.
