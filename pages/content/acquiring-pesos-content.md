When traveling internationally, it's a good idea to have some local currency in your pocket when you arrive.

> If you are getting a ride from one of our local drivers, know that they greatly prefer being paid in pesos, but in a pinch they will take US dollars.

Puerto Morelos is a tourist town, so most places accept US and Canadian dollars, but at a horrible exchange rate! Watch closely! We recommend paying with dollars only as a last resort. Instead, this page describes better ways to acquire pesos.

# Through your bank

Consider acquiring pesos from your bank at home before traveling.

- While having pesos upon arrival isn't critical, most people opt to get at least some pesos ahead of traveling.

- Most banks require that you have an account with them and it takes a couple of days to “order” them.

- Check the exchange rates and admin fees for the best rates. They can vary widely. Google _**MXN to USD**_ to see the current US Forbes/prime rate. It tells you how many cents you'll pay for a peso. For example, today's (Jan 29) rate is .058, so buying a peso costs 5.8 cents. You'll never quite get this rate, but more and more these days you can get as close as a .003 difference (so .061 in this example). This difference is one way the bank makes it's money.

- Sometimes the bank will offer you the prime rate, but charge a flat fee instead. This method typically ends up costing you more, unless you are converting a large sum. Do the math for your specific case. If it's more than suits you, just wait and get pesos in PM, especially if they try to charge you both fees!  

> Pro tip: Remember to tell your bank(s) the dates you will be traveling in Mexico using your credit card and/or debit card to lower the chances of a fraud alert while you’re in PM.

# At Mexican ATMs

- Exchange booths and ATMs at airports typically have bad rates, and Mexico is no exception.

- The exchange booths in PM give fairly decent rates. They are on the town square next to La Sirena and just past Chedraui on the ocean side.

- The ATMs in Mexico can be quirky and/or they regularly run out of pesos.

  > We recommend using ATMs that are physically connected to a bank and only when the bank is open. Much less scamming happens there and if the machine eats your card, the bank is there to help you recover it. The closest ones to camp are by the Super Aki in La Colonia. The #2 collectivo runs right by it. There are two banks and several ATMs there.

- Make sure you decline the option to calculate the dollar amount at the machine. You'll get a ***much*** better rate letting your bank do the conversion. Jan and Kevin created a [**video explaining the importance of declining the ATM exchange rate**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Sv9yaOiukrbtHwA6jmgeaU8XfWdDO2d3/view?usp=drive_link){:target="_blank"} at Mexican ATMs. It saved them about 7%!

- Be sure you are using a debit card in ATMs. Most banks treat ATM withdrawal using a credit card as a cash advance, which immediately starts accruing interest charges on your **entire** outstanding balance.

> Be on alert for the ketchup scam! Often near ATMs (but also anywhere in public where tourists have money out), if someone squirts ketchup or sauce on you, immediately put your hands on your valuables and make a scene / call out for the police. The scam is while one person draws your attention to help clean you, another person picks your pocket.

# Using credit cards

- Most places beachside take credit cards. Most places in La Colonia do not.

- Most basic credit cards charge a 3% foreign transaction fee. Check your cards and, if you don't have one that waives the 3% fee, consider acquiring one that does before you travel.

- For trust and transparency on their end, most places use a handheld credit card machine right in front of you. For your security and peace of mind, <span style="color:red">never let anyone take your credit card out of your sight</span>. And if your credit card ever does leave your hand, make sure the credit card handed back to you is yours. (Another scam is they give you a similar looking card, then head straight to the ATM with yours.)

- Like with the ATMs, make sure you/they select ***charge in pesos*** on the credit card machine. You'll get a ***much*** better rate letting your bank do the conversion. 
  
- Never use a credit card to withdrawal money from an ATM! The withdrawal is treated as a cash advance, which immediately starts accruing interest charges on your **entire** outstanding balance.

# Tips for the best exchange rate

Based on past experience, here's the order for minimizing the amount you pay for your pesos:

1. Using no 3% foreign transaction fee credit card results in the best rate by far, as long as you/they select ***charge in pesos*** on the credit card machine.<br>*Caveat: We don't know if the practice of merchants charging a credit card use percentage has caught on in PM, but keep that in mind...*

2. Converting at your bank, if you can get the .003 or so rate difference.

3. A debit card in PM (as long as you decline letting the ATM pick the conversion rate) often yields a better rate than getting pesos at home.

4. Exchanging cash for pesos at the currency exchange booths.

5. A basic credit card (that charges the 3% foreign transaction fee).<br>*Caveat: Might be better than exchange booths, depending on the booth and your credit card's bank.*

6. Only use USD or CDN at shops and restuarants as a last resort because you'll get a horrible exchange rate!

7. ***Never*** use a credit card at any ATM (anywhere worldwide)!! It’s treated as a cash advance, incurring a very high immediate interest rate on not only the withdrawal, but your entire outstanding balance!

 > Pro tip: Save your receipts and log into your online bank account the next day to calculate the rate you actually got.  

<!-- # Using Wise

[Wise](https://wise.com){:target="_blank"} is similar to PayPal and Venmo, but with a focus on international money transfers (to yourself as well as to others). More of us are using a Wise account these days because you can convert dollars to pesos whenever you feel the exchange rate is best. Their fees are very reasonable. -->
