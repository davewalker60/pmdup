We are a fragrance-free camp! Some of our dancers are sensitive to fragrances and/or have chemical sensitivities. Most perfume, scented essential oils, cologne, any strong smelling body lotions, suntan lotions, and shampoos, even washing your clothes in strong scented detergent can keep some dancers from being able to stand in the circle.

Let's be conscious and loving!
- Please do not wear perfume or essential oil in the dance circle or out to meals with other dancers.
- Please purchase fragrance-free items prior to your arrival.
