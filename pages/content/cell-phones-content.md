# Mexico plans

Refer to your mobile phone’s plan details to see if using your phone in Mexico is included in your plan to avoid surprises! For example, Verizon plans that **don’t** include Mexico charge $10/day or $100/month to use your phone outside of the US.

Some options for people without Mexico plans:

- Pick up a physical Telcel SIM card from Oxxo and choose a prepay plan at the checkout. You’ll get a Mexico telephone number with voice, text, and data. 
- Other dancers report these companies offer good phone plan and/or SIM/eSIM card options:
  - Simple Mobil
  - Airolo - ⁠Get an eSIM through their app. This option is for data only, but it’s convenient, inexpensive, and it uses AT&T, Telcel, and Movistar, so you are almost assured good reception.

# Wifi calling

Wifi is prevalent now in all PM hotels & most restaurants. If your phone plan doesn’t include Mexico and you don’t have a Mexico SIM card, you likely can get by with keeping your phone in airplane mode and using Wifi calling while in Puerto Morelos.

- To do so (at least for US iPhones) you have to go into your settings and enable a special **Wifi Calling** setting **while in the US**.

Wifi in the Cancun airport is a slightly different story. It's prevalent, but requires logging in through a web browser and is typically only free for 30 minutes. If you are relying on Wifi calling to arrange your ride, be conscious of when you activate your free 30 minutes to ensure being able to connect with your ride.
