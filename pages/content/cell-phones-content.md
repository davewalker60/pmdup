# Mexico plans

Refer to your mobile phone’s plan details to see if using your phone in Mexico is included in your plan to avoid surprises! For example, Verizon plans that **don’t** include Mexico charge $10/day or $100/month to use your phone outside of the US.

Some options for people without Mexico plans:

- Pick up a physical Telcel SIM card from Oxxo and choose a prepay plan at the checkout. You’ll get a Mexico telephone number with voice, text, and data. 
- Other dancers report these companies offer good phone plan and/or SIM/eSIM card options:
  - Simple Mobil
  - Airolo - ⁠Get an eSIM through their app. This option is for data only, but it’s convenient, inexpensive, and it uses AT&T, Telcel, and Movistar, so you are almost assured good reception.

# Wifi calling

Wifi is prevalent now in all PM hotels & most restaurants. If your phone plan doesn’t include Mexico and you don’t have a Mexico SIM card, you likely can get by with keeping your phone in airplane mode and using Wifi calling while in Puerto Morelos.

- To do so (at least for US iPhones) you have to go into your settings and enable a special **Wifi Calling** setting **while in the US**.

Wifi in the Cancun airport is a different story. <span style="color:red">We highly recommend ***NOT*** relying on airport Wifi to connect with your driver!</span> The airport WiFi is hit or miss, requires logging in through a web browser, and is typically only free for 30 minutes.

> Don't rely on Wifi calling to connect at the airport! If the airport WiFi isn't working for you, take your phone out of airplane mode. It'll cost you the daily fee from your carrier, but that's better than leaving drivers and fellow dancers in the dark. Thanks!
