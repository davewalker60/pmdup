Unlike the typical DUP/Sufi camps that happen at a contained retreat venue with on-site lodging and meals, the Puerto Morelos camp is integrated into the town with:

* Most meals taking place in small groups in restaurants
* Lodging spread out in various places (hotels, vacation rentals, airbnbs. etc...)

Because camp is an open container, rather than a closed one, it embraces a number of activities that enhance people’s experience such as:

* Snorkeling
* Cenote trips
* Mayan ruin trips
* Walks on the beach
* Exploring restaurants and cuisines
* Spending time one-on-one or in small groups with other attendees
* Music jams
* And even a Super Bowl party

All of these experiences allow for a spaciousness that most camps don’t have. 

We also believe the community creates the experience. Rather than having a focus on specific teachers, our core values are connection and Presence, both within and outside the Dance sessions.
