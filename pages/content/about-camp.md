Unlike the typical DUP/Sufi camps that happen at a contained retreat venue with on-site lodging and meals, the Puerto Morelos camp is integrated into the town, with most meals taking place in small groups in restaurants, and lodging spread out in various places (hotels, vacation rentals, airbnbs. etc...).

Because it is an open container, rather than a closed one, the camp embraces a number of activities that enhance people’s experience - snorkeling, cenote and ruin trips, walks on the beach, exploring restaurants and cuisines, spending time one-on-one or in small groups with other attendees, music jams, etc (sometimes even the Superbowl though not every year and not everyone participates - there is sometimes a lot of eye rolling on this one). All of this allows for a spaciousness that most camps don’t have. 

We also believe the community creates the experience, rather than having a focus on specific teachers; our core values are connection and Presence, both within and outside the Dance sessions.

This vision was set into place by Bernie, later joined by Sky, and you can see more about how we work at [https://skyness.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Bernie-and-Sky-Why-come.pdf](https://skyness.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Bernie-and-Sky-Why-come.pdf).
