### Tipping

- Standard restaurant and taxi tipping in Mexico is 10%.
- Please consider giving at least 20 pesos/day to your housekeepers. They get paid very, very little per hour (like 1970s US minimum wage little) and are counting on your tips, so your $1/day tips help change their lives! I (Nur al-Haqq) do this even on the days I have them skip cleaning my room.

### Getting around town

The municipality of Puerto Morelos consists two distinct parts with these nicknames:

- **Portside/Beachside** - The original seaside fishing village with the (you guessed it) beach, docks, and ocean. It’s where we dance and where nearly 100% of us stay. It largely comprises a town square and 6 surrounding blocks with shops, restaurants, and a few hotels.
  - Almost everything beachside is walkable, most places under 10 minutes.
- **La Colonia** - 2+ miles away from the beach on the west side of the highway, nicknamed “the colony”. It’s where most of the locals live and has much more authentic local cuisine and street food than portside. We sometimes take taxis there for dinner.
  - It's a 7-minute / 2-mile drive to La Colonia.
  - Taxis are for 40 pesos ($2.35 US at 17 pesos/dollar) to town (50 if you are going past Timon Ave) and by law can only take 4 passengers
  - The collectivo is a 10-peso public transportation option with lots of “local flavor”. **Please consider Wearing a mask on the collectivos** before and during camp to help keep us all healthy. 

### Staying safe in Puerto Morelos

- Valuables are fairly safe in your hotel rooms, but one can never be too careful. Most hotel rooms have a safe. If yours doesn’t, there should be one available for your use in the hotel office.
- Ketchup scam - when in public, if someone squirts ketchup or sauce on you, immediately put your hands on your valuables and make a scene / call out for the police. 
- Fentanyl warning - https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2023-06-14/fentanyl-tainted-pills-now-found-in-mexican-pharmacies-from-coast-to-coast
- Please wear a mask when riding the collectivos to help keep us all healthy. Thank you for caring about your fellow dancers!
