With people and camp activities spread out, we need a way to communicate. We use a WhatsApp community with chat groups.

> To join the community, follow the instructions on the registration form when you register. Once you've been added, please navigate to **PM Dances Community** to ensure that WhatsApp is correctly installed on your phone and that you were successfully approved as a member of the community during the registration process.

# Chat groups

For 2025, we've created the **PM Dances Community** WhatsApp community with these initial chat groups:

- **Announcements** is for daily camp announcements by staff only (no participant posting). This group is the main way we disseminate information during camp. All registrants are added to this group as part of camp registration. 

- **Dancer Chat** <span style="color: red">*(messaging currently disabled - we'll let you know when you can start posting)*</span> is an unmoderated group for conversations about and at camp. All camp registrants can join the group. All participants can post. Not everyone will want to be in this group if it gets too verbose, so **please reply privately** with thank you, I agree, etc messages and conversations that don’t involve the whole group.

- **Admin Team Only**, as the name indicates, is a group for the admin team to communicate about behind-the-scenes stuff. There's no need for any camp registrants to join this group.

> Other specialty groups might be added based on need. For example, **Post Camp** will be added at the end of camp for people staying in Puerto Morelos longer (to use for logistics like _Who's in for dinner tonight at El Pesquero's?_).

<!--**PM ‘25 Group Outings** is an unmoderated group to arrange and coordinate group trips to snorkel on the reef, cenotes, Mayan ruins, or even simply into La Colonia for a meal. The motivations for this group are:-->

<!--To reduce clutter in the main dancer chat group.-->

<!--To not require people to scroll through endless messages to find time-sensitive trip information.-->

<!--**Post Camp** is an unmoderated group that people staying in Puerto Morelos longer than camp use for logistics (like _Who's in for dinner tonight at El Pesquero's?_).  Anyone staying on after camp can join the group. All who join can post ***once camp ends***.-->

<!--After camp, **Dancer Chat** remains active for people to continue to use to connect. Please don't use **Post Camp** for postings that the whole camp might enjoy. People who return home tend to continue to live vicariously through those remaining in Puerto Morelos longer.-->

# How to reply privately

In our WhatsApp groups, when what you have to say doesn’t pertain to the whole group, reply privately to keep spamming to a minimum. For example, asking a follow-up question or commenting in a way that’s personal to the two of you. This practice helps to keep the interest level up for everyone. Thanks!

To reply privately from an iPhone:

1. Press and hold your finger on a message until the menu pops up.
2. Tap **More…**
3. Tap **Reply Privately**.

To reply privately from an Android phone:

# How to install WhatsApp

## On your phone

Installing WhatsApp on your phone is just like installing any other app. Simply search for it in either the App Store app on your iPhone or the Google Play Store on your Android phone.

## On your computer

You can simultaneously use WhatsApp on your computer and phone. We highly recommend ***against*** downloading the computer version of the app to your computer because it's buggy. Instead, use [WhatsApp Web](https://web.whatsapp.com){:target="_blank"}.

The easiest way to get started is:

1. Attempt to access our [WhatsApp community for camp](https://chat.whatsapp.com/EMbSgSrfAhiFqgHSPwd7mH){:target="_blank"}.
2. Click **Join Chat**.
3. You'll be presented a page that says the app is not installed. Instead of clicking **Download**, click **use WhatsApp Web** farther down the page.
4. Follow the prompts to complete setup and request access to the chat.
