# Chat groups

With people and camp activities spread out, we need a way to communicate. We use these WhatsApp chat groups:

- **PM Announcements ‘24** for daily camp announcements by staff only (no participant posting). Use https://chat.whatsapp.com/BDOMSleBDhu3a2uvrwGPjj to join. **Please join this group! It’ll be the best way to stay informed of the daily camp schedule.** Anyone can join and anyone can add other people.

- **PM Dances ‘24** is an unmoderated group for conversations about and at camp. Use https://chat.whatsapp.com/HrixjosWA4fLMsCFL8Vnyg to join. All participants can post. Not everyone will want to be in this group if it gets too verbose, so **please reply privately** with thank you, I agree, etc messages and conversations that don’t involve the whole group.

- **PM Lodging ‘24** for questions about / issues with lodging. Use https://chat.whatsapp.com/KkP8Uq2BZH3J0k7oqeb9s2 to join.

- **PM Post Camp ‘24** is an unmoderated group that people staying in Puerto Morelos longer than camp use for logistics (like _Who's in for dinner tonight at El Pesquero's?_). Use https://chat.whatsapp.com/KkP8Uq2BZH3J0k7oqeb9s2 to join.

  > After camp, **PM Dances '24** remains active for people to continue to use to connect. Please don't use **PM Post Camp** for postings that the whole camp might enjoy. People who return home tend to continue to live vicariously through those remaining in Puerto Morelos longer.  

# Replying privately

In our WhatsApp groups, when what you have to say doesn’t pertain to the whole group, reply privately to keep spamming to a minimum. For example, asking a follow-up question or commenting in a way that’s personal to the two of you. This practice helps to keep the interest level up for everyone. Thanks!

To reply privately from an iPhone:

1. Press and hold your finger on a message until the menu pops up.
2. Tap **More…**
