To help keep everyone well, please:

- Be cautious in your interactions in crowded and indoor spaces for at least a week before traveling, 
- Consider increasing your supplement intake for that week (especially Vitamins C and D, and zinc) and gargling with Listerine after social engagements to help keep you healthy.
- Consider wearing a mask while traveling to camp and anytime you ride a collectivo before or during camp.
- Don’t come to sessions if you are feeling ill or have symptoms. <span style="color:red">In 2025, two people who tested positive for Covid during camp thankfully had followed this advice, saving the community from a large Covid outbreak.</span> 

Thank you for caring for all of us!
