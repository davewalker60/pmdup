## Covid Care Guidelines from 2024
Covid and other illnesses are on the rise again. To help keep everyone well, please:

- Be cautious in your interactions in crowded and indoor spaces for at least a week before traveling, 
- Consider increasing your supplement intake for that week (especially Vitamins C and D, and zinc) and gargling with Listerine after social engagements to help keep you healthy.
- Take a Covid test at home before traveling, 
- Wear a mask while traveling to camp and anytime you ride a collectivo before or during camp, 
- Take a Covid test the first afternoon right before we gather (and maybe bring some extras for others or in case you start feeling ill),
- Don’t come to sessions if you are feeling ill or have symptoms. 

Thank you for caring for all of us!
