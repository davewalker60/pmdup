To enter Mexico, you need:
* A valid passport. <span style="color:red">**Check your passport expiration date!**</span> It technically can expire while you are there, but to use the automated immigration lanes at CUN, it needs to be valid for 6 months beyond your date of entry. 
* A tourist entry immigration card, <span style="color:red">**completed online before flying**</span> to expedite the immigration process. [Complete one here before flying.](https://www.cancunairport.com/tourist-card.html){:target="_blank"}
 
There are no Covid restrictions or immunization requirements.

And the customs declaration form is no longer used. All stowed luggage is now scanned by customs officers before it ever reaches baggage claim.
