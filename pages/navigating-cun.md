# VisiTAX
During Covid, QRoo instituted a [visiTAX](https://www.cancunairport.com/visitax){:target="_blank"}. They say it's mandatory, but collection is not enforced and paying can only be done online, so paying it is essentially voluntary.

Occassionally in the main departures area, someone might stop you and ask if you've paid it. It's been our experience that getting online in that moment is time consuming and often doesn't work, so we suggest saying you are nervous about making your flight and you'll look into it later. At that point, they say ok and you can walk away. Once you are at your gate, if you desire, you can voluntarily get online and pay it.
