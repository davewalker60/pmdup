Jen has been personally transformed by the direct transmission of Source energy and wisdom that the Dances offer while fostering a communal sense of peace. She is also an interfaith hospital chaplain. Learn more at [www.jenniferfriedman.com](https://www.jenniferfriedman.com){:target="_blank"} | &nbsp; ![Jen](../images/PM_Jen.jpg) |

She also facilitates “Deeper Dance” conversations at camps, where the synergistic wisdom of participants reveals wisdom about the energy and practice of the Dances, their role in our lives, and the way they can anchor spiritual truths into our way of being in the world and transform our reality.<br><br>Sky has been leading Dances at the Canyonlands/Paonia camps with Bernie for 25 years. |
| <br><span style="font-size: 160%">**Connie Zareen Delaney**</span><br>Zareen is a multifaceted Dance leader and teacher with training and certifications in diverse cultures and movements from traditional Sufism, to the Osho Multiversity, Evolutionary Enlightenment and ancient wisdom teachings.<br><br>Zareen's goal is to explore things in a way that creates a new perception. Most important is how we use our time to re-create ourselves into participating relatives of the world rather than individual consumers. Her overall vision is to come alive in new ways and jumpstart a dynamic participation in life that transforms the world… In other words: Sam Lewis’ peace project. | &nbsp; ![Connie Zareen](../images/PM_Zareen.jpg) |

He has led dances in circles across the U.S., Mexico, Guatemala, and New Zealand, supported the Beyond Initiative Caravan in Turkey and Vietnam, and pilgrimaged to India for the Urs of Hazrat Inayat Kahn.<br><br>In 2023, he joined the Board of DUP North America and became treasurer of DUP International. Douglas and his wife Deborah have been members of [The Farm](https://thefarmcommunity.com/){:target="_blank"} for over 50 years, a spiritual community founded on the principles of nonviolence and respect for the earth. When home in Tennessee, their Farm Dance Sangha gets together on Sunday afternoons. |

He spent 10 years as the webmaster for the DUP website, created the **Find Dances** database still in use today, and loves spending up to two months each winter in Puerto Morelos. | &nbsp; ![Dave Nur al-Haqq](../images/PM_DaveNaH.jpg) |

She has been coming to camp for over 10 years and, in addition to leading, offers qigong on the beach for us each morning. She's attended retreats in Spain, England, Germany, and the Czech Republic, and has been registrar and on the planning team for the Midwest DUP retreat.<br><br>In 2003, she discovered the Dances while traveling, immediately fell in love, 6 months later found the Dances close to home, and within a year, began leading. Leading and being in dance circles, connecting with the Oneness in each person has changed her life and deepened her relationship with Spirit. Her guiding mantra is *Let me do thy will, Allah*.
