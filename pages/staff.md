| ![Jen](../images/PM_Jen.jpg) &nbsp;| <br><span style="font-size: 160%">**Jen Friedman**</span><br>Jen has led sacred song and dance experiences at events around the world including the Parliament of the World's Religions 2018 in Toronto, Canada and the General Assembly International gathering of Unitarian Universalist congregations. She is a dance leader and mentor in the Dances of Universal Peace tradition and leads monthly in Longmont and Lafayette, Colorado, as well as, at Dance retreats and camps throughout the US and Mexico.<br><br>In 2023, Jen was honored to step into the role as Executive Director for Dances of Universal Peace North America. And this year is stepping into the role of spiritual director of the Puerto Morelos camp. |
| <br><span style="font-size: 160%">**Bernie Heideman (hopefully)**</span><br>Bernie has been leading for over 30 years, was a founding leader at the original Canyonlands Camp, is on staff for Wilderness Camp, started the Puerto Morelos Winter Dance retreat, and has led at other events in the US, Europe and Russia. He is a master at explosive joy and wild energy, but underneath that apparent frivolity he is always guiding us into the presence of “Presence.”<br><br>He brings a lot of joy, laughter and music circles to his events and can hold a huge space for everyone to first expand into and then to sink into the depths of their own soul experience. | &nbsp; ![Bernie](../images/PM_Bernie.jpg) |
| ![Sky](../images/PM_Sky.jpg) &nbsp; | <br><span style="font-size: 160%">**Sky Safir Roshay**</span><br>Sky has been organizing Dance camps in the United States and Mexico since 1999. She also facilitates “Deeper Dance” conversations at camps, where the synergistic wisdom of participants reveals wisdom about the energy and practice of the Dances, their role in our lives, and the way they can anchor spiritual truths into our way of being in the world and transform our reality.<br><br>Sky has been leading Dances at the Canyonlands/Paonia camps with Bernie for 25 years. |

He spent 10 years as the webmaster for the DUP website, created the **Find Dances** database still in use today, and loves spending up to two months each winter in Puerto Morelos. | &nbsp; ![Dave Nur al-Haqq](../images/PM_DaveNaH.jpg) |
