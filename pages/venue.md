Camp takes place immediately adjacent to the main Puerto Morelos beach in two locations:

* Dance sessions take place on the ocean side of Hotel Las Arenas Puerto Morelos. We dance on the sandy ground under a shade sail in the mornings and under the stars at night.
* Classes and late-night music jams take place at Alaska House, a private rental on the beach, across the side street next to the hotel.

The Hotel Las Arenas Puerto Morelos is an affordable 2-star hotel on the beach. It's clean, definitely not the Ritz, and has its quirks! "It's Mexico!" 
  * Best price on the beach by far, especially with our group rate!
  * Most rooms have microwaves and mini fridges.
  * We'll be setting up a simple community kitchen and chill space in one of the rooms.
  * Make friends with the geckos, keep food sealed to avoid attracting ants, and a little bit of tape on torn screens keeps the mosquitos out... You get the idea...

The Alaska House (aka "the dance house") has a beautiful, fenced patio with an amazing ocean view.
  * Staff stays here during camp and other extended-stay dancers move in as staff departs. This year, we have the house for a whole month!
  * There's a full kitchen for use by those staying in the house only.

Additional lodging is available at many places around towm. [Learn more here.](./arrange-lodging.md)
