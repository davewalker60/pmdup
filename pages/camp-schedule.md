# Camp activities

## Dance sessions

Dances of Universal Peace sessions happen each morning under the shade structure and each evening under the stars. We are in the elements, so the wind, sun, and rain adds to the concentration. We sometimes move the session to under one of the big palapas on the other side (street side) of the hotel when the weather is too much of a distraction. 

## Qigong

For 30 minutes each morning, Jessie Sitara leads us in an all-levels Qigong practice either on the beach or near the dance circle space when it's too windy on the beach.

## Other class offerings

As we get closer to camp, other afternoon offerings will emerge and be described here. Offerings in the past include doing art, singing, meditation, Sufi teachings, cacao ceremony, crystal bowl sound journey, and more. Stay tuned for this year's offerings... 

## Rumi cafe

One highlight of camp for many people is the Rumi Cafe, a time to share your poetry, music, comedy skits, or whatever way you'd like to showw off your talents to our very loving and supportive community.
