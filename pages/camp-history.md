Since 2001, we've been dancing each winter in Puerto Morelos. That means this coming February, we'll be celebrating the Puerto Morelos Dance Camp's 25th anniversary.

Founded by Bernie and Adrianna Heideman, it has become a unique tradition attracting a diverse attendance from North America and Canada during those countries’ winter months and acts as a connecting event with dancers and Dance leaders in Mexico.

In the winter months of 1999 and 2000, Bernie and Adrianna visited Puerto Morelos and were so enchanted by the laid-back atmosphere and accessibility of the town, they had the idea for a Dance retreat.

The first few years were relatively informal, but by 2006 the retreat had its “legs” and was held consistently on the beach in front of the Alaska House, which we affectionately call *the Dance House*. The Alaska House sits across the street from the hotel where we currently dance, has primarily hosted camp staff, and is the home of our community offerings and late-night music jams, during and after camp.

Around 2010, dancing moved to the hotel property, which has changed names many times over the years. First called Villas Latinas, then Dos Naciones, Hotel Villas de Mar, and now Hotel Las Arenas.

Most Dance sessions happen on the ocean side of the hotel on the sandy ground. In the mornings, we dance underneath a shade structure and thanks to several dancers with rock climbing and other technical/rope knowledge, the shade retracts for us to dance underneath the beauty of the night sky and stars in the evening. In the event of rain or other unforeseen circumstances, we dance underneath the palapa which is in front of the Dance Hotel.

While there have been numerous guest leaders (for example, Hakima Greentree, Grace Marie, Tara Andrea, Allaudin Ottinger), the last 10 years focalized around the leadership of Bernie Heideman, Sky Roshay, and more recently, Jen Friedman.

In 2022, “our pandemic year,” we held camp entirely on the back patio of Alaska House with Jen, Sky, and Dave Nur al Haqq serving as primary leaders. We socially-distanced for all activities and had strict Covid protocols. Due to travel restrictions and cancellations, our camp was very intimate that year (with a brave 23 people!) but this created ample space for deepened connection and sharing. The idea of community offerings was born here, as anyone who felt inspired to share their particular skill or gift was encouraged to do so. It has become a beloved community tradition to facilitate a deepened experience of connection and the sacred. These offerings led by participants frequently include art, meditation, kirtan, cacao ceremony, sound healing, philosophical discussions, and more...

Zareen Connie Delaney was added as a main leader in the post-pandemic years, helping to hold the leadership pole in Bernie’s absence. In 2024, our dedicated team of certified Dance leaders who have supported the camp for the last 5-10 years were added to the community leadership team. An additional 8-10 Dance leaders attend and all who would like to lead are supported to do so at least once during camp.

In some years, we have hosted a community dance, either in the town square or community center, which is open to local members of the community to share the welcoming energy and spirit of our beautiful tradition with new people.

Jen Friedman stepped forward in the role of Spiritual Director in 2025, with the blessing, encouragement, and mentorship of Bernie and Sky. Jen hopes to build on the legacy and tradition of the PM Camp as a community-collaboration, celebrating the energy, passion, and heart of all who attend.
