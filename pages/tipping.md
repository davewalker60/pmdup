### Tipping

- Standard restaurant and taxi tipping in Mexico is 10%.
- Please consider giving at least 20 pesos/day to your housekeepers. They get paid very, very little per hour (like 1970s US minimum wage little) and are counting on your tips, so your $1/day tips help change their lives! I (Nur al-Haqq) do this even on the days I have them skip cleaning my room.
