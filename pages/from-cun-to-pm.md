This page covers various ways to get from the CUN airport to the retreat. The most common (and highly-recommended) way is to  rideshare with us. Whether riding with us or not, <span style="color: red">please complete the [travel form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSex7cyDs_Xf33rAxqU2S749xG_MB4lMQk3fPvF_p0JkkoKyTg/viewform){:target="_blank"} once you’ve registered and have booked your travel to Mexico.</span> Thanks!

# Group rate rides

Once you clear customs at CUN, the scene is quite a zoo! But no need to be intimidated; it’s part of the adventure! To lessen your potential overwhelm, we are arranging rides for all who want them. 

- We’ll connect you with your driver and he will meet you at the curb.
- Our discounted rate is 600 pesos or $30 paid directly to the driver. This price is definitely the best rate for a private car and 1/2 the price of getting into a taxi at the airport without an advance reservation!
- To use our service, you must complete the [**travel form**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSex7cyDs_Xf33rAxqU2S749xG_MB4lMQk3fPvF_p0JkkoKyTg/viewform){:target="_blank"} well in advance of your arrival date.

> We are also arranging rideshares to the airport at the end of your trip.

# Arranging your own ride

## By taxi or private car

- The best rate we’ve found online is to pre-arrange a ride using the [CLICK HERE FOR DISCOUNTED RATES](https://cancun.ridebitsapp.com/central/new_reservation){:target="_blank"} link on the [Cancun International Airport](https://www.cancunairport.com/taxi.html){:target="_blank"} website.
- Avoid hailing a taxi at the airport. Some people have been charged as much as triple ($90 yikes!). In fact, in an attempt to lessen the badgering, the airport has made it “illegal” to hail a cab at the curb. They (and we) highly recommend pre-arranging your ride. 

## By bus/taxi combination

<span style="color: red">**There no longer is a bus that goes from the airport directly to PM!**</span> Getting to PM by bus is still possible, but it takes a minimum of two hours by either:

- Taking an ADO bus north from the airport through traffic to downtown Cancun, walking across the street, getting on a Playa Express bus to Playa del Carmen (driving right back through the same traffic jam past the airport), getting off at Puerto Morelos, then taking a taxi or [the collectivo](https://puertomorelos.mx/producto/colectivos/){:target="_blank"} from the highway to your accommodations.
- Taking an ADO bus south from the airport (driving right past Puerto Morelos) to downtown Playa del Carmen, getting on a Playa Express bus to Cancun, getting off at Puerto Morelos, then taking a taxi  or [the collectivo](https://puertomorelos.mx/producto/colectivos/){:target="_blank"} from the highway to your accommodations.

There is a taxi/collectivo stand on the east side of the highway (around the corner from where the northbound buses stop).

## By rental car

The Cancun airport is modern, on par with typical US domestic airports, complete with an in-airport rental car center. Check with your own car insurance company to see if your policy covers you while in Mexico.
