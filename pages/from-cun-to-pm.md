This page covers various ways to get from the CUN airport to the retreat. The most common (and highly-recommended) way is to rideshare with other dancers. Regardless of the way you choose, <span style="color: red">please complete the [travel form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSex7cyDs_Xf33rAxqU2S749xG_MB4lMQk3fPvF_p0JkkoKyTg/viewform){:target="_blank"} once you’ve registered and have booked your travel to Mexico.</span> Thanks!

<!--# Group rate rides

Once you clear customs at CUN, the scene is quite a zoo! But no need to be intimidated; it’s part of the adventure! To lessen your potential overwhelm, we are arranging rides for all who want them. 

- We’ll connect you with your driver and he will meet you at the curb.
- Our discounted rate is 650 pesos or $35 per car, paid directly to the driver upon arrival in Puerto Morelos. This price is definitely the best rate for a private car and 1/2 the price of getting into a taxi at the airport without an advance reservation!
- To use our service, you must complete the [**travel form**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSex7cyDs_Xf33rAxqU2S749xG_MB4lMQk3fPvF_p0JkkoKyTg/viewform){:target="_blank"} well in advance of your arrival date.

# Coordinating a ride with other dancers

Follow these steps to coordinate a rideshare with other dancers:
1. Complete and submit the [travel form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSex7cyDs_Xf33rAxqU2S749xG_MB4lMQk3fPvF_p0JkkoKyTg/viewform){:target="_blank"} to add your arrival info to the rideshare spreadsheet.
2. Join the [Airport Rides chat group](https://chat.whatsapp.com/DiL8kawPPIw4NtxV25MOsq){:target="_blank"} to communicate about rides.
3. Consult the [rideshare spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSZSq4OF3O0hydC8OsEiC3n-gKzCRPGZj7wdRLIrn2qmSydI9kxBq9tinuZeEohARD7pqrylkqyNyrQ/pubhtml?gid=1287951932&single=true){:target="_blank"} to determine who is arriving about the same time as you are.
4. Contact potential rideshare dancers directly (if you have their contact info) or through our WhatsApp community (if they aren't in the Airport Rides group, contact them privately from the [Dancer Chat](https://chat.whatsapp.com/EMbSgSrfAhiFqgHSPwd7mH){:target="_blank"} group and encourage them to join the Airport Rides group).
5. Refer to the **Arranging your ride** section below to arrange a driver.
6. Once you've arranged your ride, post a message in the Airport Rides chat group naming the people in your group and your driver. We'll monitor the chat and update the spreadsheet accordingly.

> At camp, you'll also be able to coordinate rideshares to the airport for the end of your trip.

# Arranging your ride

## Our driver recommendations

- If the best rate is your priority, pre-arrange a ride with a commercial driver using a credit card for as little as $32usd (for the firstAVAILABLE option) via the [transportation page](https://www.cancunairport.com/transportation.html){:target="_blank"} on the Cancun International Airport website. We've successfully used this service in the past, but making the reservation can be a bit hit or miss.

- For a very reliable, no hassle commercial driver option, we've arranged a special 850 peso per ride discounted rate with a local commercial driver company based in Puerto Morelos. (Their usual rate is 1000 pesos, which seems kinda high.) Reservation must be made a minimum 24 hours before arrival/pick up time and you must tell them you are with the dance group. Via WhatsApp, contact:
  - Raul +52 1 998 222 2860 (up to 4 people and luggage)

- For dancers who know the Family & Friends non-commercial pickup routine, contact these drivers via WhatsApp. All are extremely reliable and charge just 600 pesos per ride.
  - Geordie +52 1 998 195 6385 (up to 2 people and luggage)
  - Darren  +52 1 998 474 1228 (up to 4 people and luggage)
  - Howard  (contact through WhatsApp community) (up to 4 people and luggage)

> If you don't know the Family & Friends routine but want to learn it, please read [Navigating CUN](navigating-cun.md) and, if you are still interested, [request assistance here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeKsY-e9iy44578E1ijjs_g5Bwi1gZCuW439N1bOBlL76U5qg/viewform){:target="_blank"}.

## By taxi or private car

- The best rate we’ve found online is to pre-arrange a ride using the [transportation page](https://www.cancunairport.com/transportation.html){:target="_blank"} on the Cancun International Airport website.
- Uber seems to be available now, and at reasonable rates. If you try it out, let us know how it goes!
- Avoid hailing a taxi at the airport. Some people have been charged as much as triple ($90 yikes!). In fact, in an attempt to lessen the badgering, the airport has made it “illegal” to hail a cab at the curb. They (and we) highly recommend pre-arranging your ride.
- **Never** use a credit card with a taxi driver at the airport! They'll say it didn't work and send you to someone else, but in reality they just stole your card info or successfully charged a bunch to your card.

## By bus/taxi combination

***September '25 update:** Rumors are circulating that ADO is stopping briefly in PM again, **if you can talk the driver into pulling off**. Also note, the driver **will not** under any circumstances open the luggage compartment underneath, so if you try taking this bus, absolutely take your luggage **onto** the bus with you. Good luck and let us know how it goes...*

<span style="color: red">**January '24: There no longer is a bus that goes from the airport directly to PM!**</span> Getting to PM by bus is still possible, but it takes a minimum of two hours by either:

- Taking an ADO bus north from the airport through traffic to downtown Cancun, walking across the street, getting on a Playa Express bus to Playa del Carmen (driving right back through the same traffic jam past the airport), getting off at Puerto Morelos, then taking a taxi or [the collectivo](https://puertomorelos.mx/producto/colectivos/){:target="_blank"} from the highway to your accommodations.
- Taking an ADO bus south from the airport (driving right past Puerto Morelos) to downtown Playa del Carmen, getting on a Playa Express bus to Cancun, getting off at Puerto Morelos, then taking a taxi  or [the collectivo](https://puertomorelos.mx/producto/colectivos/){:target="_blank"} from the highway to your accommodations.

There is a taxi/collectivo stand on the east side of the highway (around the corner from where the northbound buses stop).

## By rental car

The Cancun airport is modern, on par with typical US domestic airports, complete with an in-airport rental car center. Check with your own car insurance company to see if your policy covers you while in Mexico.

## By train

The Tren Maya is fully operational, but only runs from Cancun south twice a day. There's a free shuttle from the airport to the train station and it costs 130 pesos to take the train to PM. Then it's another 250 pesos for a taxi from the train station to the beach village.

If you are trying to do it really on the cheap, you possibly can walk from the Puerto Morelos train station out to the road and wait for the collectivo (but we know how that can go...). Unless you are gonna use the collectivo, it's cheaper (and a heck of a lot faster) to take a prearranged taxi door to door.
