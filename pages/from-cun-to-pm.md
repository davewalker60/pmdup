Once you’ve registered and have booked your travel, please complete the [**travel form**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSex7cyDs_Xf33rAxqU2S749xG_MB4lMQk3fPvF_p0JkkoKyTg/viewform){:target="_blank"}.

# Group rate rides

Once you clear customs at CUN, the scene is quite a zoo! But no need to be intimidated; it’s part of the adventure! To lessen your potential overwhelm, we are arranging rides for all who want them. 

- We’ll connect you with your driver and he will meet you at the curb.
- Our discounted rate is 600 pesos or $35 paid directly to the driver. This price is definitely the best rate for a private car and 1/2 the price of getting into a taxi at the airport without an advance reservation!
- To use our service, you must complete the [**travel form**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSex7cyDs_Xf33rAxqU2S749xG_MB4lMQk3fPvF_p0JkkoKyTg/viewform){:target="_blank"} well in advance of your arrival date.

# Arranging your own ride

- The best rate we’ve found online is to pre-arrange a ride using the [CLICK HERE FOR DISCOUNTED RATES](https://cancun.ridebitsapp.com/central/new_reservation){:target="_blank"} link on the [Cancun International Airport](https://www.cancunairport.com/taxi.html){:target="_blank"} website.
- Avoid hailing a taxi at the airport. Some people have been charged as much as triple ($90 yikes!). In fact, in an attempt to lessen the badgering, the airport has made it “illegal” to hail a cab at the curb. They (and we) highly recommend pre-arranging your ride. 

#### By bus

<span style="color: red">**There no longer is a bus that goes from the airport directly to PM!**</span> Getting to PM by bus is still possible, but it takes a minimum of two hours by either:

- Taking a bus through traffic to downtown then getting on another bus to drive right back through the same traffic jam past the airport and on to PM
- Taking the airport bus right past PM to downtown Playa del Carmen then getting on another bus to return to PM.
