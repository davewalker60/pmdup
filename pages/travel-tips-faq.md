Traveling to a foreign country requires a bit more awareness than traveling domestically, but it doesn't need to be stressful, especially to the Mexican state of Quintana Roo (QRoo), Cancun, and Puerto Morelos.

# Do I need to speak Spanish?

No. While it is helpful (as well as respectful) to know the language, you can almost always find someone who speaks some English almost everywhere throughout QRoo.

We do recommend installing an app like Google Translate on your phone and making Spanish available offline.

# Can I use American money?

Most people will accept USD, but you'll ***always*** get a horrible exchange rate. Before traveling, we recommend [acquiring some pesos from your local bank](acquiring-pesos.md).

# Where in Puerto Morelos does camp take place?

# Is getting there difficult?

No, not if you follow a couple of simple steps. The Cancun airport (CUN) is becoming more and more like a US domestic airport each year. But... the vendors outside of customs can seem intimidating and finding your ride at the curb can be a bit tricky. [Navigating CUN](./navigating-cun.md) seamlessly guides you through the process. 

And [pre-arranging your transportation from CUN to Puerto Morelos](from-cun-to-pm.md) helps.

# Where do I stay when I get there?

[Lodging Options](./lodging-options.md) describes the layout of Puerto Morelos and provides an abundance of places to stay.

The great majority of the dancers stay at Hotel Las Arenas, where we dance. [Learn more about booking a room.](booking-las-arenas.md)
