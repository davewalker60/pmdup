Traveling to a foreign country requires a bit more awareness than traveling domestically, but it doesn't need to be stressful, especially to the Mexican state of Quintana Roo (QRoo), Puerto Morelos, and the rest of the Riviera Maya.

# Do I need to speak Spanish?

No. While it is helpful (as well as respectful) to know the language, you can almost always find someone who speaks some English almost everywhere throughout QRoo.

We do recommend installing an app like Google Translate on your phone and making Spanish available offline.

# Can I use American money?

Most people will accept USD, but you'll ***always*** get a horrible exchange rate. Before traveling, we recommend [acquiring some pesos from your local bank](acquiring-pesos.md).

# Does "don't drink the water" apply to QRoo?

Yes, even most locals experience intestinal distress by drinking water from the tap. Most lodging places, including Las Arenas, provide drinking water in 20-litre containers. We recommend bringing a sturdy water bottle with you and using it to avoid filling the landfill with small plastic bottles.

# And what about eating raw fruits and vegetables?

Eating improperly-washed fruits and vegetables raw also can result in intestinal distress. Cooking them and/or soaking them in water with disinfectant drops kills the bacteria. Restaurants are, for the most part, extremely safe. It's a tourist town and a bad reputation travels fast, so they understand the need to prepare the food correctly.

# Will my cell phone work there?

Yes, cell reception is prevalent throughout the Riviera Maya, but [make sure your cell plan includes Mexico](./cell-phones.md) and/or keep your phone in airplane mode and rely on the equally-prevalent WiFi.

# Where in Puerto Morelos does camp take place?

# Is getting there difficult?

No, not if you follow a couple of simple steps. The Cancun airport (CUN) is becoming more and more like a US domestic airport each year. But... the vendors outside of customs can seem intimidating and finding your ride at the curb can be a bit tricky. [Navigating CUN](./navigating-cun.md) seamlessly guides you through the process. 

And [pre-arranging your transportation from CUN to Puerto Morelos](from-cun-to-pm.md) helps.

# Where do I stay when I get there?

[Lodging Options](./lodging-options.md) describes the layout of Puerto Morelos and provides an abundance of places to stay.

The great majority of the dancers stay at Hotel Las Arenas, where we dance. [Learn more about booking a room.](booking-las-arenas.md)
