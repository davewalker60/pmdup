Each February, we gather 20 miles south of the Cancun airport in Puerto Morelos, Quintana Roo, Mexico to "eat, dance, and pray" together at the Puerto Morelos Dances of Universal Peace camp.

Even though the once quaint seaside village is growing and changing, we still love it there and continue to gather as a DUP community each winter to eat, dance, pray, relax, swim, sun, and adventure together.
