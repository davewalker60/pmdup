Welcome to the official website for the Dances of Universal Peace camp held 20 miles south of the Cancun airport in Puerto Morelos, Quintana Roo, Mexico each February.

Even though the once quaint seaside village is growing and changing, we still love it there and continue to gather as a DUP community each winter to eat, dance, pray, relax, swim, sun, and adventure together.

The site contains everything you need to know to join us!

Site navigation:
* Expand the navigation menu to access each individual topic.
* Expand the **More Options** menu to access quick reference links to the most frequently used items.

We look forward to dancing in the sand with you!

> A note about the colors: The colors used in this website are the colors of the sand, sea, and sky of the Puerto Morelos beaches. If you look closely at the gradient banner, you can even see the horizon!
