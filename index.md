### <span style="color:red">*Website creation in progress... Most everything on this site still needs team collaboration (and accenting with photos that display well on a phone). Nothing, **including dates and prices**, is finalized yet...<br><br>As we discussed at our wrap up meeting in PM, the intention of the site is to replace last year's Google Doc with concise chunks of text, easily readable on a phone (as well as computer), that provide info about camp as well as external activities available in QRoo both during and after camp.<br><br>I look forward to collaborating when the time is right! To keep updating organized, use **Collaborate** at the top of any page at any time and capture your ideas for improving that page. Thanks!*</span>

Each February, we gather together on the Riviera Maya in Puerto Morelos, Quintana Roo, Mexico (20 miles south of the Cancun airport) for a Dances of Universal Peace retreat. The 2025 retreat is tentatively schedued for Feb 13-19, with pre-camp prep & dance on Feb 12.

Even though the once quaint seaside village is growing and changing, we still love it there and continue to gather as a DUP community each winter to eat, dance, pray, relax, swim, sun, and adventure together.

This website describes the retreat/camp, the town, local activities, and everything you need to know to register and prepare for traveling to Mexico. Start with the [**Travel Tips FAQ**](pages/travel-tips-faq.md).

We look forward to dancing in the sand with you!

> The colors used in this website are the colors of the sand, sea, and sky of the Puerto Morelos beaches. If you look closely at the gradient banner, you can even see the horizon!
