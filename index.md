### <span style="color:red">*Website creation in progress... As of April, most everything on this site still needs team collaboration (and accenting with photos that display well on a phone). Nothing, **including dates and prices**, is finalized yet...<br><br>As we discussed at our wrap up meeting in PM, the intention of the site is to replace last year's Google Doc with concise chunks of text, easily readable on a phone (as well as computer), that:<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Entice newcomers with info about DUP dancer life in Puerto Morelos before, during, and after the retreat time, including external activities available in QRoo.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Clearly explain to newcomers how this is a different kind of camp experience.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Provide all camp details so people can search for answers on their own.<br><br>I look forward to collaborating! To keep updating organized, use **Contact Us** at the top of any page at any time and capture your ideas for improving that page. Thanks!*</span>

Each February, we gather together on the Riviera Maya in Puerto Morelos, Quintana Roo, Mexico (20 miles south of the Cancun airport) for not just a Dances of Universal Peace retreat but also to experience all the Riviera Maya has to offer before, during, and after the retreat.

> The 2025 retreat starts the evening of Wednesday Feb 12 (with pre-camp dance space prep on Feb 11 & 12 - come join in the fun!) and ends after the evening circle on Tuesday Feb 18.

Even though the once quaint seaside village is growing and changing, we still love it there and continue to gather as a DUP community each winter to eat, dance, pray, relax, swim, sun, and adventure together.

This website describes the retreat/camp, the town, local activities, and everything you need to know to register and prepare for traveling to Mexico. If you are new to Puerto Morelos, start with the [**Travel Tips FAQ**](pages/travel-tips-faq.md).

We look forward to dancing in the sand with you!

> The colors used in this website are the colors of the sand, sea, and sky of the Puerto Morelos beaches. If you look closely at the gradient banner, you can even see the horizon!
