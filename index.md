Each February, we gather together in Puerto Morelos, Quintana Roo, Mexico (20 miles south of the Cancun airport) for a Dances of Universal Peace retreat.

Even though the once quaint seaside village is growing and changing, we still love it there and continue to gather as a DUP community each winter to eat, dance, pray, relax, swim, sun, and adventure together.

This website describes the retreat/camp, the town, local activities, and everything you need to know to register and prepare for traveling to Mexico.

We look forward to dancing in the sand with you!

> The colors used in this website are the colors of the sand, sea, and sky of the Puerto Morelos beaches. If you look closely at the gradient banner, you can even see the horizon!
