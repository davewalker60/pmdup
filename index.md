Each February, we gather together on the Riviera Maya in Puerto Morelos, Quintana Roo, Mexico (20 miles south of the Cancun airport) for not just a Dances of Universal Peace retreat but also to experience all the Riviera Maya has to offer before, during, and after the retreat.

Even though the once quaint seaside village is growing and changing, we still love it there and continue to gather as a DUP community each winter to eat, dance, pray, relax, swim, sun, and adventure together.

This website describes the retreat/camp, the town, local activities, and everything you need to know to register and prepare for traveling to Mexico. If you are new to Puerto Morelos, start with the [**Travel Tips FAQ**](pages/travel-tips-faq.md).

# For 2026...

Dates for the 2026 retreat are not yet finalized, but we suspect camp will start sometime between the evening of Friday Feb 13 and Thursday Feb 18, and be for the same 7-day length as in 2025. There again will likely be [pre-camp dance space prep](pages/preparing-dance-space.md) on the two days prior and potential for pre-camp and post-camp dances the day before and the day after the official retreat dates.
<!-- and ends after the evening circle on Wednesday Feb 19.-->

Come join in the fun! We look forward to dancing in the sand with you!
